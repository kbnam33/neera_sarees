**Retry failed steps:**

1. Identify the step number for each failed checkbox
2. Re-execute only those specific steps
3. Maximum 2 retry attempts per step
4. After retries, re-check the verification checklist

**Example:** If "Backup pushed to remote" is unchecked:
- Re-run: `git push origin backup-react-spa`
- Re-check: `git branch -r | grep backup-react-spa`
- If now checked: Continue
- If still unchecked after 2 retries: Escalate to critical failure

**After retries:**
- Re-check all 12 boxes in "Verify These Results" section above
- If now all checked → Follow "All Checkboxes Checked" path above
- If still 1-2 unchecked after retries → Escalate to critical failure below
- If 3+ still unchecked → Proceed to critical failure below

---

### ❌ If 3+ Checkboxes Are NOT Checked OR Critical Failure

**Phase 0 Self-Check: FAILED**

This indicates serious issues that cannot be auto-resolved.

**Update PROGRESS.md:**

Change the Phase 0 section to:

```markdown
## Phase 0: Project Initialization
- **Status:** ❌ FAILED
- **Failed At:** [Insert current time]
- **Duration:** [Start to failure time]
- **Failed Checks:**
  - [List each unchecked checkbox]
- **Issues:**
  [Describe what went wrong for each failed check]
- **Blockers:**
  - Cannot proceed to Phase 1 without resolving these issues
  
***

## BLOCKERS:
- Phase 0 initialization failed with [X] unresolved issues
- Manual intervention required before proceeding

***

## USER ACTIONS REQUIRED:
- Resolve Phase 0 initialization failures
- Review failed checks above
- Update user.md when resolved
```

**⛔ STOP WORKFLOW EXECUTION**

Display detailed message to user:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⛔ PHASE 0 BLOCKED - Manual Intervention Required
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Phase 0 initialization has failed with multiple issues that require
your attention before the transformation can proceed.

❌ FAILED CHECKS:
[List each unchecked checkbox from verification]

📋 RESOLUTION STEPS:

For PROGRESS.md issues:
- Ensure you have write permissions in project directory
- Verify disk space available
- Try creating PROGRESS.md manually if automated creation failed

For Backup branch issues:
- Verify Git is installed: git --version
- Check remote repository access: git remote -v
- Ensure you have push permissions to repository
- Try: git push origin backup-react-spa --force (if safe)

For Supabase credential issues:
- Double-check credentials in Supabase Dashboard
- Ensure .env.local format is correct (no extra spaces)
- Verify Supabase project is active (not paused)
- Test connection directly in Supabase Dashboard

For Git repository issues:
- Resolve any merge conflicts
- Commit or stash uncommitted changes
- Ensure on main or master branch
- Verify repository is not corrupted

After resolving all issues above:

1. Re-check the verification checklist manually
2. Confirm all 12 items can now be checked
3. Update user.md with: "Phase 0 issues resolved - ready to retry"

The workflow will re-run Phase 0 verification after your confirmation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**⏳ Wait for user.md confirmation**

Monitor user.md for resolution signal.

**Accepted signals:**

- "Phase 0 issues resolved - ready to retry"
- "issues resolved"
- "ready to retry"
- "fixed"
- "all resolved"
- Or similar confirmation language

**After user confirms resolution:**

1. Re-run the entire "Verify These Results" checklist (all 12 checks)
2. If all boxes now checked → Follow "All Checkboxes Checked" path
3. If still failing → Log as unresolvable and end workflow with error report

---

## Expected Duration

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

**Breakdown:**

- Step 1 (Create PROGRESS.md): 1 minute
- Step 2 (Create backup): 1-2 minutes
- Step 3 (Check credentials): 30 seconds
- Step 4 (Test connection): 1 minute
- Step 5 (Verify data): 1 minute
- Step 6 (Check Git): 30 seconds
- Verification checklist: 2-3 minutes

**Note:** Duration excludes user wait time if credentials need to be provided. If user action required, add time for user to locate credentials and update user.md.

## Common Issues \& Solutions

### Issue 1: Backup branch already exists from previous attempt

**Solution:** This is acceptable. Verify the branch exists and is pushed to remote. No need to delete and recreate. The existing backup serves the same purpose.

**Action:** Check the box and continue. Not an error.

---

### Issue 2: Product count is less than 130

**Solution:** Log the actual count in PROGRESS.md and continue. The transformation will work with any number of products. 130 is expected based on current data, but fewer products don't block initialization.

**Action:** Note the discrepancy but don't treat as failure. Continue with actual product count.

---

### Issue 3: .env.local already exists but connection fails

**Solution:** Credentials are incorrect or Supabase project has issues.

**Actions:**

1. Verify credentials in Supabase Dashboard (Project Settings → API)
2. Check if Supabase project is paused (free tier inactivity)
3. Try logging into Supabase Dashboard to confirm account access
4. Copy fresh credentials from dashboard
5. Update .env.local with verified credentials
6. Retry connection test

---

### Issue 4: Git shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean" but backup fails to push

**Solution:** Remote repository access issue.

**Actions:**

1. Check remote URL: `git remote -v`
2. Verify you have push access to repository
3. Try: `git push origin backup-react-spa --verbose` to see error details
4. Check GitHub/GitLab credentials or SSH keys
5. If authentication fails, update Git credentials
6. Retry push

---

### Issue 5: Permission denied when creating PROGRESS.md

**Solution:** File system permission issue in project directory.

**Actions:**

1. Check directory permissions: `ls -la`
2. Verify you have write access to project directory
3. Try creating file manually: `touch PROGRESS.md`
4. If manual creation works, retry Step 1
5. If permission denied, resolve directory permissions with system admin

---

### Issue 6: Products table doesn't exist in Supabase

**Solution:** Database not set up or wrong Supabase project.

**Actions:**

1. Verify correct Supabase project URL in .env.local
2. Check Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → Confirm "products" table exists
3. If table missing, this is critical blocker for entire transformation
4. PAUSE workflow, inform user that products table must exist
5. Cannot proceed without product data

---

### Issue 7: user.md monitoring - how to know when user is done?

**Solution:** User.md doesn't exist initially.

**Actions:**

1. User creates user.md file in project root when workflow pauses
2. User adds confirmation text (any natural language)
3. Workflow detects any update to user.md as potential signal
4. Workflow reads content, looks for confirmation intent
5. If confirmation detected, workflow resumes

**Note:** user.md is created by user on-demand, not by workflow. If workflow needs to pause and user.md doesn't exist yet, instruct user to create it.

---

**END OF PHASE 0**

Phase 0 completion is confirmed when all 12 checkboxes in "Verify These Results" are checked and PROGRESS.md is updated with "✅ COMPLETED" status.

Control returns to generate.mdc orchestrator for external verification before proceeding to Phase 1.
